## Introduction
I’m a Chinese CS (Computer Science) student in HFUT (HeFei University of Technology). I hope to do research in the field of computer systems in the future. I would probably pursue a master's degree in HFUT, with a focus on Multi-core systems and Network on Chip (NoC).

Here are some of my current interests:
- The Rust programming language
- RISC-V ISA
- LaTeX

I'm also an otaku who is involved in all areas of ACGN, especially in the area of Animation, Comic and (Gal)Game. You can find more info at [here](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/User:Eslzzyl).

I want to be good at drawing in the future.
