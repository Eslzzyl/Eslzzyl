## Introduction
I’m a Chinese CS (Computer Science) student in School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, HFUT (HeFei University of Technology). I will pursue a master's degree in HFUT, with a focus on low-level computer vision or deep-learning-driven image processing.

I'm also an otaku who is involved in all areas of ACGN, especially in the area of Animation, Comic and (Gal)Game. You can find more info at [here](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/User:Eslzzyl).
